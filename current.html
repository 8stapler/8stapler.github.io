                    The main project I'm currently working on is my senior project, a Computational Experiment Pipeline. The purpose of the project is to 
                    provide an easy-to-use, dynamic system for running time-consuming computational experiments with many iterations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team's current plan for
                    the system is to have a GUI which the user enters the experiment in the form of an executable file and a range of variables for the experiment.
                    The system then distributes the workload to a network of devices which perform the experiments and return the results to a database. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project is open-source and the repository for the code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/GLADOSPipeline/Monorepo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
                    So far we have the databases and an early version of the distribution system and front-end set up. We don't have every part connected yet, but 
                    we are currently testing and bug-fixing the components by themselves.
