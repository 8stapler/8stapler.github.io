                    I just started my final year of college and am taking Bio-Inspired AI, Cognitive Psychology, Baroque, Classical, and Romantic Music, 
                    and starting my senior project. My senior project is titled "Computational Experiment Pipeline" and is a system for automating the 
                    processes of distributing computation across available machines, collecting and organizing data, and visualizing and analyzing results
                    for experiments with a computational model. Other than that, I'm mostly focusing on getting back into the routine of college and applying 
                    for jobs. I'm excited to graduate college and start working, but I also had a lot of fun in college so I'm kind of reluctant to see it 
                    all end.
