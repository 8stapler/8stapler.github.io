                    The main project I'm currently working on is my senior project, a Computational Experiment Pipeline. The purpose of the project is to 
                    provide an easy-to-use, dynamic system for running time-consuming computational experiments with many iterations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team's current plan for
                    the system is to have a GUI which the user enters the experiment in the form of an executable file and a range of variables for the experiment.
                    The system then distributes the workload to a network of devices which perform the experiments and return the results to a database. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are currently
                    pretty early in the project so our work so far has mainly been in planning and communicating with the client to ensure our system meets their needs.
                    Our project is open-source and the repository for the code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/GLADOSPipeline/Monorepo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Currently, however,
                    there isn't much there except for a couple prototypes I made for the system that runs the experiments.
