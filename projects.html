                <h3>June 2020 - Present</h3>
                <p>I am currently developing an action RPG with original art and music. It is written in the Godot Engine using GDScript, an object-oriented 
                    programming language similar to Python. You can try out a short demo below.

                <h3>September 2021</h3>
                <p>I created a program in Python that uses a generational loop, mutation, selection, and genetic crossover to evolve a picture that looks similar to a sample photo given. 
                    You can view short videos of pictures in my program evolving below.

                <h3>March 2021 - May 2021</h3>
                <p>I collaborated with two other students to create a simple os in C with a command-line shell, file system, and 
                    the ability to run processes in parallel. The source code and some pictures of the shell when it's running are available below.

                <h3>December 2020 - February 2021</h3>
                <p>Created a system in Java with two other students for handling coffee orders
                    using various design patterns such as strategy pattern, decorator pattern, and factory pattern. I included
                    the source code and a picture of the uml we used to model the design of the system.

                <h3>September 2020 - November 2020</h3>
                <p>Designed an interpreter with a team in Scheme to parse source code, translate the code into a set of instructions, 
                    and execute the instructions.

                <h2>Super Smash Bros Database</h2>
                <h3>March 2020 - May 2020</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented a database with a small team of other students using Transact-SQL in Microsoft SQL 
                    server to track games, characters, and other data from the video game series Super Smash Bros. System
                    also included front-end access application designed in Java. The original database is no longer available, 
                    but I've included a link to the code for the front-end application and the ER diagram we used to design the database.
