                <p>I created this page back when I was in college to show some of the class/personal projects I was working on.
                    You can view the source code for these projects and learn more about them through 
                    demos and pictures of them in action from my project page. The project I'm most proud of is a video game I've been working on. I was planning
                    on making a full game a few years ago, but paused progress on it to work on other things. You can play a demo from early in development on
                    my project page.</p>
                <p>I studied abroad in Japan back when I was in college. I really enjoyed it and have since visited several more times.

                <p>I enjoy running, playing piano, and ice-skating. I also have had some success in competitive esports recently for the game Pokemon Unite, with several top 8 placements in official tournaments
                    and a peak placement of 3rd in North America.
