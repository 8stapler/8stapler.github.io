                    The main idea for the database was a resource for information on characters, moves, stages, and items in the
                    Super Smash Bros Series. Users would be able to register an account in the database and search for various information
                    across several different games, as well as register a favorite game and character for their account. Since the same 
                    characters, items, and stages appear across multiple games in the series with different stats, we utilized weak entities 
                    to ensure that they could appear multiple times in the database with different attributes.
