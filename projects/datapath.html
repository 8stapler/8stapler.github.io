                    Our architecture is multicycle and is based on a load-store design. Its words, instructions, and register
                    addresses are all 16 bits. The aim of the architectureâ€™s design is to complete
                    instructions quickly and prepare for the next operation at the same time. The A and B
                    registers are used to store the two numbers that the ALU performs operations on. The
                    result of the ALU operations is placed in a temporary register for later use. The
                    architecture supports two instruction formats: DR, which utilizes four control bits to clear
                    or move values in the A and B register, and I, which is used for instructions involving
                    immediates.
